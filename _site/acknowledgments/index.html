<p>
  Throughout my Bachleor's degree, which I undertook in Computer Science and Engineering from Karunya University, Coimbatore, India; I did extensive work and research in the information security domain. 
  While I was not tinkering about new thoughts in the field of security, I dedicated my time in bug hunting to help secure organisation online. <br>
  I also found two major security flaws (<a href="https://bit.ly/3Dm2ZuE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IRCTC Account Takeover</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3jhTVPm" rel="nofollow"target="_blank">Personal Data Leak of Users and Booking Rooms for Rs. 1</a>) in IRCTC website, which is the official e-ticket booking portal of the India Railways. For this, I was covered by online new portals including Times of India Paper, Coimbatore.
