<i>Hi to the one on the other side of the screen ! </i><br><br>
I am Ronnie. Currently, I work as security researcher in a firm in Hyderabad, India; where my day to day work involves finding zero days in popular open source applications.  I conduct both SAST and DAST analysis on various applications present in Github which covers a wide variety of ecosystems like NPM, Ruby, Nuget, PHP, Java etc and report findings to the project maintainers to get the vulnerability patched asap :P <br>
<p>
 My interest in computers started quite young, though I started to have a browsable internet connection way late in my Senior year in school. During those days, I was tinkering with the sole Android mobile in our house; rooting, installing custom ROM’s , throttling processors etc.  I also started my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/geekslider" target="_bl">YouTube Channel</a> where I continue to upload interesting videos related to tech and hacking even now! 
</p>
I pursued my B. Tech. in CSE from Karunya University, Coimbatore.  During the freshman year, I developed keen interest in learning about SEO (Search engine optimisation) and started a blog, geekslider(.)com which I later sold to my college alumni. 
<br>
In the upcoming years at college, I realized I had more interest into breaking applications, playing CTF and finding security loopholes. 
I coincidently found a security bug in a very popular image editing site; through which I was able to access their premium functionality for free, while I was trying to create logo for by blog. <br>
<p>
The bug was patched and the site rewarded me under their “Bug Bounty Program”. 
That was the beginning of a  wonderful  journey in the infosec field and I reported security issues in a couple of sites. I have been acknowledged in the Security Hall of Fames of all Big 3 : Google, Facebook and Microsoft . You may please read more about that <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/acknowledgments/" target="_blank">here.</a> <br>
<p>
While at my junior year in college, I was selected by Facebook, as one among 30 students from Asia-Pacific region to attend an invite only security conference and live hacking event, Bountycon 2019 in Singapore. The conference enabled me to interact with top security researchers worldwide. <br><br>

I was also the first Microsoft Student Partner from my university; through which I organised seminars for students. 

Some of my talks/seminars are:<br>

<p>
Please read more of my  technical works <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/projects/">here.</a>
</p>
I am also exploring varius OSINT data gathering techniques; and as a part in this direction, volunteered as judge in Trace Labs CTF, organized at Defcon USA, 2021 to aid in finding missing people. <br><br>

I also volunteer at Kerala Police Cyberdome; which brings together Law Enforcement Agencies and industry experts from Public Domain for combating cyber crimes.  I spend my free time reading novels and researching about upcoming cyber attacks. I also published my first book on Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083DZP3YY" target="_blank">Grey Voice</a> which is a collection of 10 short stories and poems. 
</p>
  <p>
    By nature, I am a very simple person; and love to hangout with humble people.<br>
