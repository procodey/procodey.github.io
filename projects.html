  I did brief research on various subdomain enumeration techniques and tools; and also another one about different phishing techniques which are availabe on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie-Joseph-3" target="_blank">Researchgate.</a> 
One of my other interesting research is <i> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-pretended-software-developer-working-indian-govt-attract-joseph/"target="_blank">Manuka Honeypot Analysis</a></i> where I analyzed if hackers where able to fetch tokens dropped in obscure Github repositories. <br><br>
Some CVE's (Common Vulnerability Exposures) assigned to me for finding flaws in applications are:
<ul id="contact-details">
    <li>
      CVE-2019-768: Post based XSS in Jio Routers
    </li>
    <li>
      CVE-2020-12882: Stored XSS leading to ATO
    </li>
</ul>

I  made several community contributions via security writeups and continue to remain as the Editor of the Medium Publication, <a href="https://medium.com/bug-bounty-hunting" target="_blank">Bug Bounty Hunting</a>, which is followed by more than 3k+ people. 
<br><br>
I also host a very popular twitter bot <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBugBot" target="_blank">@TheBugBot</a> , which aids fellow researchers to get cyber security tips. 
<br><br>
Apart from this, some of my relevant projects are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/humblelad" target="_blank">Github.</a>
